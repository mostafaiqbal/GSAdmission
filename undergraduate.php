         One of the most important condition for obtaining a university admission on a bachelorâ€™s degree program is to have an appropriate high school certificate and or a foundation certificate.  Students from the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Oman and Kuwait need to have a suitable High School Certificate (Al Thanaweya). Students who do not meet the English proficiency certificate such as IELTS can still get a conditional offer. Once the student meets the conditions mentioned on the conditional offer, the offer is then changed to unconditional offer. Students with International Baccalaureate Diploma can start from the first year directly without the need of the Foundation program, ie the preparatory year, but it depends on the university selected.
