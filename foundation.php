    <h3>Foundation Courses</h3>
    <p>
    Foundation courses are an excellent starting point if you do not have the required grades or if you feel that you need some further preparation before you start your Bachelorâ€™s degree. Or if you only studied 12 years at School before University.
    We work continuously with educational establishments who provide higher education with a focus on future employment. Whatever degree you would like to pursue, whatever career path you have chosen, we are able to put you on the right track to a vast range of courses that will appeal to you.

    <p>
    There are many different types of courses on offer. Many are work-related and will therefore help prepare you for when you graduate and enter the professional arena. The quality of teaching and content of the courses are second-to-none and are aimed at providing students with a thorough understanding and knowledge of their particular area of interest in a relaxed and supportive academic environment. There is an abundance of excellent resources available to students; there is assistance available if you need help with your accommodation, travel, health, leisure requirements, and much more.
