    <strong>Study costs in Britain</strong> <br>
    The cost of studying varies from one university to another and from one city to another. London is generally the most expensive city in the UK. Some students prefer to study in cities far away from London such as the North and South of Britain, but we can say that the costs of the bachelor’s degree can cost between 12 thousand to 15 thousand pounds and rises for clinical and medical programs to reach about 40 thousand and may exceed it.

    University Accommodation (on campus) – the cost is about 150 pounds per week and the price varies if the room is shared. <br>
    Private House or Apartment – and the costs of about 90 pounds per week and vary from one area to another.
